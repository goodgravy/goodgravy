# Hello! I'm James ðŸ‘‹
Currently, I lead technology at [Spring](https://www.spri.ng/) where we're defining and pushing forward the "creator commerce" space.

Iâ€™m interested in e-commerce, alternative monetisation mechanisms, artificial intelligence, â€¦Â and mountain biking.

### Learning about
- Safety concerns around artificial intelligence (via the [Cambridge AGI safety course](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals))
- Machine learning interpretability (via [Eleuther's Interpretability reading group](https://www.eleuther.ai/), this [NeurIPS workshop](https://explainml-tutorial.github.io/neurips20), and reading [this book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/))
- Large language models
